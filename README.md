## Access from Other Devices

The server runs on all network interfaces, so you can access it from other devices on your network:

## File Storage

Downloaded files are stored in the `downloads/` directory within the project folder.

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **yt-dlp**: YouTube video/audio downloader
